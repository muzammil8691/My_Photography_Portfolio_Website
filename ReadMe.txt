Photography Portfolio Website

Overview

Welcome to my Photography Portfolio Website repository! This project showcases my work as a photographer and is the culmination of a month-long effort to design and build a platform that not only highlights my photography but also provides a seamless user experience.

Features

1. Sidebar Navigation
One of the key components of the website is the custom sidebar navigation.

2. Hover to Edit
The gallery features an intuitive "hover-to-edit" functionality, where users can hover over pictures to see the edited version of the photo.

3. Animations
To enhance the visual appeal, I've incorporated various animations throughout the site.

4. Gallery Layout
The photo gallery is designed using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox, ensuring a responsive layout that looks great on all screen sizes.

5. Technologies Used
